            tell-me-everything is a very simple flask app for anonymous users to post
            their thoughts on "The Wall"! <br>It uses flask as the backend framework and 
            sqlite for database. It is currently deployed on heroku obviously! <br>
            It might be sometimes that your post is not sent, so resend if it does not show
            up on the wall! <br>
            <br> Type in an anonymous username and speak your mind! Please don't spam, as 
            I have not yet implemented the spam filter. Lol.
